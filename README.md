I completed a 3-hour virtual internship with J.P. Morgan, analyzing ABC Corpâ€™s financials, identifying trends, and making data-driven recommendations. I reviewed income statements, assessed profitability, and created concise reports. This experience strengthened my skills in financial analysis, reporting, and decision-making.
